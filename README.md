==========

Syntax to draft contracts with terminal-style commands (think: "style_PromissoryNote" sticks a set of variables into a 
promissory note template).  This was initially presented by Jonathan Moore and Boris Polonia ([bpolonia](https://github.com/bpolonia)) at [Code the Deal](http://codethedeal.com).  

We hope that our members and followers will more fully develop the ontology of the syntax, as well as develop some applications for the final product (how about a GUI?).  We think there are a number of applications for this syntax:

* The log of commands could serve as metadata for a document that could be read, or written, by humans (and machines) more quickly.
* Humans could write scripts that automate the creation of hundreds of documents in a few seconds, with little to no technical knowledge (or knowledge of MS Word's more automatable features).
* In some cases, it may be possible to hardcode and detect bugs and logical inconsistencies in contracts.  E.g., you could get an error message if you use an undefined term.
* Defining terms and cross-referencing terms and sections in a very easy way.
